### Military Influence

Military MOS: 13D - Tactical Data specialist

The principal founder of the company proudly served as a 13D in the US Army. This is a Tactical Data Specialist and he credits this training and experiences across two combat deployments for much of his value system and ability to think critically.

### Computer Science

Windows Bug: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/bug-check-0x13d--critical-initialization-failure

We think the nature of this Microsoft Windows bug accurately reflects what so many of our clients experience from a variety of system issues. Something at the heart of your IT process simply fails to initalize. Maybe it happens at the begining of the day, maybe the end, or maybe on the weekend. In any of these scenarios the common thread is that the solution to the problem is rarely obvious.

#### OOODA Loop Implementation

* **Observe:** Operational Tempo is the ideal running state.
* **Orient:** Planning/Assessment for remediation or feature deployment via a _planning_ phase.
* **Decide** how the problem should be solved through _design_.
* **Act:** Implementation of the design.
* **Test:** Confirm the solution matches or improves the operational tempo.

### History

Hex value of 0x13d is '317'. 3/17. Commonly known is the western world as March 17. <strong>St. Patricks's Day</strong>. Another of our founding partners enjoys this connection to thier Irish heritage. However as students of history we also draw inspriation to these other significant times in history which also occured on March 17:

### Philosophy and Spirtuality

While we wouldn't often call ourselves a spiritual lot it's important recognize 0x13D in all of it's forms:

```

James 3:17 - But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.

```

We then wonder if it's just by chance that the highly competitive and very expensive Williams College has the following course

```

NSCI 317 - Nature _via_ Nurture: Topics in Developmental Psychobiology

```

## The C.A.D.A mindset

We are a small strike team best suited to small projects or staff augmentation. We can lead, or we can follow. The C.A.D.A mindset is one we employ to every engagement to ensure we are addressing the issues which are mission critical to the project. Our focus is always key to the following concepts to prevent scope creep and project run away.

### Create - The Solution. 

Striving to add value to every step of the design process. Documentation, design, blue sky sessions, and final reviews are all something we help make more productive.


### Attack - The Implementation

Security should be a first class citizen during development and implementation. Allow us to layer a defense in depth strategy which will help ensure that the final phases of the project don't slip.

### Defend - The Attack

When holes are discovered we're there to help patch them. Our goal is to help do this behind closed doors as a trusted part of your team. Let us augement your workflow with key confidence indicators that can bubble up to stake holders in a way that help drive the whole project forward.

### Advise - Improve and Repeat

Whether you need a consultant to simply help with a few rough spots, or a top down analysis of a solution we are ready to assist.
