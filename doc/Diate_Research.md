# Dilate - Vision Redefined

## Research

### Identify Dominate Eye

> NOTE: It seems possible that holding a cell phone in a certain hand trains you to favor one eye over the other. Example: I usually use my left hand to hold my tablet/cell phone. This leads to a slight tilt where I notice a reliance on my left eye over right for acuity. Switching hands makes this difference in acquity more apparent. Is this naturally casuing muscles in one eye to atrophy?

### Evoltuion and Human Faces

```
The fovea—the 1% of your visual field at the center that has high resolution—is small. To see how small, hold your arm out, stick up your thumb, and focus on your thumbnail. At arm’s length, your thumbnail is about the size of your fovea. The rest of your visual field can be considered peripheral vision, with significantly lower resolution [Johnson, 2014]. [^1]
``` 

``` 
First, peripheral vision provides low-resolution cues to guide our eye movements so that our fovea visits all the interesting and crucial parts of our visual field. Our eyes don’t scan our environment randomly. They move so as to focus our fovea on important things, the most important ones (usually) first. The fuzzy cues on the outskirts of our visual field provide the data that helps our brain plan where to move our eyes, and in what order. [^1]
```


```
While the visual system has, for example, been shown to compute summary representations of facial expression, gender, or identity, it is less clear whether perceptual input from all parts of the visual field contributes equally to the ensemble percept. Here we extend the line of ensemble-representation research into the realm of race and look at the possibility that ensemble perception relies on weighting visual information differently depending on its origin from either the fovea or the visual periphery. We find that observers can judge the mean race of a set of faces, similar to judgments of mean emotion from faces and ensemble representations in low-level domains of visual processing. [^2]

> NOTE: The below research suggests that the initial difficulty in using the Dilate method could in part do to other topics of sustained attention. This is interesting when combined with the eye strain (twitches/spasms) found when users first use the system. There is a discomfort and visceral desire to stop similar to exercise. A non-trivial connection between exertion, eye strength, and attention might be drawn.

```
Many clinical populations that have sustained attention deficits also have visual deficits. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how the quality of visual input and different forms of image degradation can contribute to worse performance on sustained attention tasks, particularly those with dynamic and complex visual stimuli. [^3]

> NOTE: Jordan Peterson noted that our focal center of about the size of your thumb nail held at arms lengths comes from our evolutionary needs. That it was very important to see and understand the human face at that distance. If this is hard wired then we should use human faces and especially those of children in our eye exercises.
