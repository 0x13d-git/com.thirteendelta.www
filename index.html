            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Thirteen Delta (13D) is a open source research and development firm focused on sustainable housing. All profits are directed towards a phased approach designed to demonstrate a mixed application of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), solar power, and economic building techniches to provide rental equity to qualifying candidates.</p>

            <p>The goal is to provide equity options to the tenant without increasing cost or risk to the owner, and without raising rent above market rates.</p>

            <p>A secondary goal of this project is to create greenspaces used for community enrichment and agriculture research. Microsoft (Azure) Farmsbeats provides an establish model for data collection and analysis. The stated benefit of achieving this goal is having real time information about neighborhood green spaces as well as growing historical data concerning thier condition.</p>
                
            <p>The following revenue and cost cutting opportunities will be implemented in an effort to study the current day feasibility of such a program:

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Solar Panels: </strong> A combination of high efficency systems, local solar generation/storage, and SREC (solar renewable energy credits). Suggests that a 1,000 sqft home generating 1MW (megawatt) of power per month could see a utility savings of greater than $100/mo and potential sale of SRECs at the current market rate of $70/mo.</li>
                    <li><strong>Helium LoRa and 5G Mining: </strong> A combination of LoRa (long range / wide area) proof of coverage mining and 5G offloading services. By taking advantage of recent policy changes concerning CBRS (Citizens Broadband Radio Service) it's beleived that a well positioned CBRS node should produce between $100 and $200 or profit per month.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sunamp Thermal Battery (Hot Water):</strong> The Sunamp solution allows for 80% efficiency when converting from solar to thermal storage. This approach when integrated has a two fold benefit of removing a large power consumer from both the home and the local grid.</li>
                    <li><strong>Microsoft (Azure) Farmbeats:</strong> used for data storage and analysis of the sensor mesh network. Low-cost sensors, drones, and vision and machine learning algorithms can be directly applied to the LoRa/5G mesh network and access mediated by the Thirteen Delta Operations Dashboard (Copperhead).</li>
                    <li><strong>Copperhead Operations Dashboard:</strong> a next generation operations dashboard is required to effectively provide community access to the vast amount of data collected. Thirteen Delta has researched, developed, and self funded this software explicitly for this application.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>The theoretical revenue of the strategy above is conservitively $200 to $400 per month. Thirteen Delta proposes a rental equity system that sees yearly dividends to renters of up to 20% of rental fees.</p>

            <p>There is a yet to be studied positive social impact of bringing a new class of investor into the market, helping them gain financial literacy, and building accessible equity during early or vulnerable life stages. To this end, structured data will be made available to any organization wishing to study the research conducted by Thirteen Delta.</p>
